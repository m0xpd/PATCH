# Socket Board

This folder contains design files for the "Socket Board", which is a common element of all PATCH applications. The files are in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) format.

The Socket Board carries six "Thonkiconn" 3.5mm sockets (by which it mounts to the Front Panel) and two 9*1 0.1 inch female header sockets (by which other PATCH boards plug onto the back of the socket board. I find it convenient to cut these 9-way receptacles down from 40-way units, which I keep in stock.
