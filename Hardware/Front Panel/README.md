# Front Panel

This folder contains design files for a front panel for the PATCH system, expressed as a [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project.

Remember that the schematic is 'empty' - the front panel has no electrical connections.

The front panel has no labels/annotation, because each instance of the system will be put to different use; you can add labels convenient to your own application if you need to.

I find it convenient at least to use different nuts on the sockets to remind me which are inputs and which are outputs, from which I can remember the configuration of the PATCH module.
